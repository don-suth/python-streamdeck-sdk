# python-streamdeck-sdk

An asynchronous fork of the original [Streamdeck Python SDK](https://github.com/gri-gus/streamdeck-python-sdk) by [gri-gus](https://github.com/gri-gus). The code was changed to use asynchronous methods and uses the `websockets` library instead of `websocket-client`. 

Tested minorly with Python 3.11, and with Streamdeck 6.2.
